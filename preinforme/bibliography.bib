abstract = {Autonomous service robots will have to understand vaguely described tasks, such as “set the table” or “clean up”. Performing such tasks as intended requires robots to fully, precisely, and appropriately parameterize their low-level control programs. We propose knowledge processing as a computational resource for enabling robots to bridge the gap between vague task descriptions and the detailed information needed to actually perform those tasks in the intended way. In this article, we introduce the KnowRobknowledge processing system that is specifically designed to provide autonomous robots with the knowledge needed for performing everyday manipulation tasks. The system allows the realization of “virtual knowledge bases”: collections of knowledge pieces that are not explicitly represented but computed on demand from the robot's internal data structures, its perception system, or external sources of information. This article gives an overview of the different kinds of knowledge, the different inference mech...},

@article{Winkler2014,
abstract = {Agents that learn from experience can profit immensely from memorizing what they have done, why, how, and what happened. For autonomous robots performing complex manipulation tasks, these memories include low level data, such as perceptual snapshots of relevant scenes that influ- enced decision making, detailed complex motions the robot performed, and effects of these mo- tions. They also include high level representations of the intended actions and the belief-dependent descisions that led to the chosen course of action. In this paper, we propose CRAMm, a memory management system that can record very comprehensive and informative memories without slow- ing down the operation of the robot. CRAMm offers a query interface that allows the robot to retrieve the kinds of information stated above. This is done using a first-order logical language that provides predicates concerning the beliefs and intentions of the robot, its physical state, perceptual information, and action effects and their relations at various different levels of abstraction.},

@article{Jockel2008,
abstract = {Different disciplines such as psychology and neuroscience have been examining episodic memory (also referred to as declarative memory) for more than three decades. Now, engineering and computer science are developing an increasing interest in episodic memory for artificial systems. We propose a novel framework EPIROMEto develop and investigate high-level episodic memory mechanisms which can be used to model and compare episodic memories of high-level events for technical systems.We demonstrate how we applied the framework to the domain of service robotics. High-level events emanate from basic skills, elementary operations, sequences of elementary operations, environmental changes and the detection of human interactions. The framework enables our service robot TASER to collect autobiographical memories to improve action planning based on past experiences. The framework provides the robot with a life-long memory since past experiences can be stored and reloaded. In practise, one main advantage of our episodic memory is that it provides one-shot learning capabilities to our robot. This reduces the disadvantage of other learning strategies where learning takes too long when used with a real robot system in natural environments and therefore is not feasible.},
